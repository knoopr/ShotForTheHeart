	<h1> About </h1>
	<!--<p> Shot for the heart is a semester long campus wide game of tag with the goal of raising funds for the Heart and Stroke foundation of Canada. The way the game works is that for every $20 you raise you are given a new piece of information about your "target" as you unlock more pieced of information it becomes easier to find your target. The last 2 people in the game are given prizes.</p>-->
	<p>Welcome to Shot for the Heart! We are a unique charity event at the University of Guelph in support of the Heart and Stroke Foundation. We run as a registered club under the Central Student Association. Our goal is to promote fundraising and awareness for heart and stroke health to all students and members of the community by hosting an innovative game of tag. Participants are given a target and every $15 you raise will go towards unlocking information on your target. As you unlock information it becomes easier to find your target and you are also helping an organization that supports critical research on heart disease and stroke. Join us to help prevent disease, save lives and promote recovery by competing to keep hearts beating!</p>
	<p>Please contact the Shot for the Heart team at sftheart@uoguelph.ca with any questions.</p>
